        PERIYAR E.V. RAMASAMY: A person’s personality is described by his/her interests, activities and most importantly his social roles. Usually, our traits are best explained by public support that we gain in our lifetime. Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy (17 September 1879 – 24 December 1973) is one of those legends who supported good for his people and fought for it. He was also known as “Thanthai Periyar” or “Periyar” means “respected one” or “elder”. For his rebellion temperament against social discrimination, Brahmins dominance, oppression against women, etc., he is also called as “Father of Dravidian Movements”. His Dravidian movements gave birth to DMK, AIDMK, and MDMK.

        Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar[a] (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Often regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans Eysenck, "he tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".[4
